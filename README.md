#Pose Estimation and Exercise Tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This Python project leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect human poses in real-time from a webcam stream. It then analyzes the body posture to determine if the user is performing squats or pushups correctly, providing visual feedback.

#Key Features:

1)Real-time Pose Detection: Utilizing MediaPipe's Pose solution, the script accurately tracks 33 human body landmarks.
Exercise Recognition: Built-in support for squats and pushups. Customize the exercises dictionary to add more exercises.
Posture Feedback: Visually indicates whether the user's posture aligns with proper exercise form.
Video Recording (Optional): Saves the exercise session to an output video file (configurable).
Installation:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3 and OpenCV (pip install opencv-python) installed.
MediaPipe: Follow the official installation instructions at [invalid URL removed].
Usage:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone https://github.com/harsharajkumar/personal-trainer-using-cv.git
Run the Script: Execute python main.py (replace main.py with your script's filename if different).
Webcam Access: The script will automatically access your webcam for pose detection. Press q to quit.
Configuration (Optional):

exercises Dictionary: Modify this dictionary in the script to define custom exercises with their corresponding landmark ranges for posture verification.
Video Recording: To enable video recording, uncomment the lines related to fourcc and out in the script.
Expected Output:

Real-time video feed displaying detected body landmarks.
Textual feedback indicating "Correct posture" or "Incorrect posture" based on the exercise being performed.
(Optional) Recorded video file (output.avi) containing the exercise session.
